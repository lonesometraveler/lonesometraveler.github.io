In this post, I will talk about my first experiment with [Real Time For the Masses (RTFM) Framework](https://github.com/rtfm-rs/cortex-m-rtfm). My understanding is that RTFM finds itself between bare metal and Real Time OS. Bare metal's small footprint is great for a resource constrained platform. But managing resources and tasks can be very difficult. Real Time OS provides rich features. However, it comes with so much overhead. RTFM provides an ability to easily schedule tasks and guarantees safe access to shared resources without much runtime overhead.

Here are RTFM's features listed in [the doc](https://rtfm.rs/0.5/book/en/preface.html).

> - **Tasks** as the unit of concurrency. Tasks can be event triggered
>   (fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on
>   demand.
> 
> - **Message passing** between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to
>   software tasks at spawn time.
> 
> - **A timer queue**. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time
>   in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.
> 
> - Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus, **preemptive multitasking**.
> 
> - **Efficient and data race free memory sharing** through fine grained \*priority
>   based\* critical sections.
> 
> - **Deadlock free execution** guaranteed at compile time. This is an stronger
>   guarantee than what's provided by the standard Mutex
>   abstraction.
> 
> - **Minimal scheduling overhead**. The task scheduler has minimal software
>   footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.
> 
> - **Highly efficient memory usage**: All the tasks share a single call stack and
>   there's no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.


## Timer interrupt with RTFM

This week’s program toggles an LED when triggered by timer interrupts. 

**Hardware**

- [Nucleo-F429ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f429zi.html)

**Crates**

- [stm32f4xx-hal](https://crates.io/crates/stm32f4xx-hal)
- [cortex-m-rtfm](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtfm)

**Code**

Full code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lonesometraveler/stm32f4xx-examples/blob/master/examples/rtfm_2.rs)

### Implementation

This experiment is basically a redo of [my timer interrupt experiment from a few weeks ago](https://github.com/lonesometraveler/stm32f4xx-examples/blob/master/examples/timer_interrupt_2.rs). Let's look at how I did it without RTFM.

**Without RTFM**

```rust
static LED: Mutex<RefCell<Option<PB7<Output<PushPull>>>>> = Mutex::new(RefCell::new(None));
static TIMER_TIM2: Mutex<RefCell<Option<Timer<stm32::TIM2>>>> = Mutex::new(RefCell::new(None));

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    let dp = stm32::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
    let rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();
    let clocks = rcc.cfgr.sysclk(48.mhz()).freeze();

    // Set up the LED
    let gpiob = dp.GPIOB.split();
    let led = gpiob.pb7.into_push_pull_output();

    // Set up the timer
    let mut timer = Timer::tim2(dp.TIM2, 5.hz(), clocks);
    timer.listen(Event::TimeOut);
	
    // Move shared resources to Mutex
    free(|cs| {
        TIMER_TIM2.borrow(cs).replace(Some(timer));
        LED.borrow(cs).replace(Some(led));
    });

    // Enable interrupt
    stm32::NVIC::unpend(stm32::Interrupt::TIM2);
    unsafe {
        stm32::NVIC::unmask(stm32::Interrupt::TIM2);
    }

    loop {}
}

#[interrupt]
fn TIM2() {
    free(|cs| {
        if let Some(ref mut tim2) = TIMER_TIM2.borrow(cs).borrow_mut().deref_mut() {
            tim2.clear_interrupt(Event::TimeOut);
        }
        if let Some(ref mut led) = LED.borrow(cs).borrow_mut().deref_mut() {
            led.toggle().unwrap();
        }
    });
}
```

The application does these:
1. use Mutex for shared resources that can be accessed from user and ISR contexts
1. enable TIM2 interrupt with NVIC
1. handle interrupt requests in `#[interrupt]` and toggle the LED

Now, let's do the same with RTFM. Implementation with RTFM looks like this. 

**With RTFM**

```rust
#[rtfm::app(device = hal::stm32, peripherals = true)]
const APP: () = {
    struct Resources {
        led: PB7<Output<PushPull>>,
        timer: Timer<stm32::TIM2>,
    }

    #[init]
    fn init(cx: init::Context) -> init::LateResources {
        let rcc = cx.device.RCC.constrain();
        let clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze();

        // Set up the LED
        let gpiob = cx.device.GPIOB.split();
        let led = gpiob.pb7.into_push_pull_output();

        // Set up the timer
        let mut timer = Timer::tim2(cx.device.TIM2, 5.hz(), clocks);
        timer.listen(Event::TimeOut);

        // Initialization of late resources
        init::LateResources { led, timer }
    }

    #[task(binds = TIM2, resources = [timer, led])]
    fn tim2(cx: tim2::Context) {
        cx.resources.timer.clear_interrupt(Event::TimeOut);
        cx.resources.led.toggle().unwrap();
    }
};
```

This looks very different from what we have seen so far. To start, there is no `#[entry]` attribute. This may be confusing. We are supposed to initialize resources, enable interrupts, and infinitely loop in `main` like this.

```rust
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
	// configure pins, set up interrupt, wrap shared resouces with Mutex, etc.
    loop {}
}
```

Also, we can’t find `NVIC` anywhere either. Below is how we normally enable a timer interrupt without RTFM.

```rust
stm32::NVIC::unpend(Interrupt::TIM2);
unsafe {
    stm32::NVIC::unmask(Interrupt::TIM2);
}
```

So, where are our `#[entry]` and functions to enable interrupts? 

RTFM framework uses macros. When we use attributes like `#[init]` and `#[task]`, they expand and generate `main` and all that.  

Code generation happens in the background and we don’t need to see the expanded code. We can just build an app and flash it to a device. But I think it is a good idea to see what exactly RTFM is doing first. At least for me, seeing the expanded code helped me understand what was going on. 

**Expanded Code**

```rust
#[allow(non_snake_case)]
fn init(cx: init::Context) -> init::LateResources {
    let rcc = cx.device.RCC.constrain();
    let clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze();
    let gpiob = cx.device.GPIOB.split();
    let led = gpiob.pb7.into_push_pull_output();
    let mut timer = Timer::tim2(cx.device.TIM2, 5.hz(), clocks);
    timer.listen(Event::TimeOut);
    init::LateResources { led, timer }
}

        let mut core: rtfm::export::Peripherals = core::mem::transmute(());
        let _ = [(); ((1 << hal::stm32::NVIC_PRIO_BITS) - 1u8 as usize)];
        core.NVIC.set_priority(
            hal::stm32::Interrupt::TIM2,
            rtfm::export::logical2hw(1u8, hal::stm32::NVIC_PRIO_BITS),
        );
        rtfm::export::NVIC::unmask(hal::stm32::Interrupt::TIM2);
        core.SCB.scr.modify(|r| r | 1 << 1);
        let late = init(init::Context::new(core.into()));
        led.as_mut_ptr().write(late.led);
        timer.as_mut_ptr().write(late.timer);
        rtfm::export::interrupt::enable();
        loop {
            rtfm::export::wfi()
        }
    }
};
```

I find it very interesting to read the expanded code line by line. I can see `fn main()` at the bottom of the expanded code. In `main`, interrupt is enabled with `NVIC` and it infinitely waits for interrupts.

Although I don't understand everything, it seems to me that resources are nicely managed with `mod`. I guess RTFM makes it a bit easier to handle resources and tasks. 

### Attributes

This is how our RTFM application is constructed.

```rust
#[rtfm::app(device = hal::stm32, peripherals = true)]
const APP: () = {

    struct Resources {
        led: PB7<Output<PushPull>>,
        timer: Timer<stm32::TIM2>,
    }

    #[init]
    fn (cx: init::Context) -> init::LateResources  {
        // omitted
    }
	
    // not used for this week's experiment
    // #[idle]
    // fn idle(c: idle::Context) -> ! {}

    #[task(binds = TIM2, resources = [timer, led])]
    fn tim2(c: tim2::Context) {
        // omitted
    }
};
```
Let’s look at the four attributes: `app`, `init`, `idle` and `task`.

#### 1.`app`

All RTFM applications start with `app`.

```rust
#[rtfm::app(device = hal::stm32, peripherals = true)]
const App(): = {
    //
}
```

`device` argument is mandatory. We want to specify a path to our PAC crate here. In my case, it is `stm32f4xx-hal`’s `stm32`. 

`periperals = true` makes it possible to access PAC’s core and device modules. For example, `let rcc = cx.device.RCC.constrain();`

#### 2. `init`
`app` expects initialization functions in `#[init]`. This is the first thing that runs in a RTFM application. Interrupts are always disabled in this. We initialize resources in here.

#### 3. `idle`
We don’t use this for this week's experiment. But when we have this task, it runs after `init` with interrupt enabled. 

#### 4. `task`
`#[task]` attribute makes it possible to declare interrupt handler. Use `binds` to attach a handler to a specific interrupt.

```rust
#[task(binds = UART0)]
fn uart0(_: uart0::Context) {
    //
}
```
It is possible to set priority using `priority` argument. A higher priority task preempts a lower priority task. If not specified, the priority is set to 1. (`idle` task has the lowest priority, 0.)

```rust
#[task(binds = UART0, priority = 1)]
fn uart0(_: uart0::Context) {
    //
}

#[task(binds = UART1, priority = 2)]
fn uart1(_: uart1::Context) {
    //
}
```

[See the RTFM doc for more info](https://rtfm.rs/0.5/book/en/by-example/app.html).

### Shared Resources

Before `#[init]`, we have `Resources`. These are late resources we want to initialize at runtime. 

```rust
struct Resources {
    led: PB7<Output<PushPull>>,
    timer: Timer<stm32::TIM2>,
}
```

These are like Mutexes we used in a previous experiment. 

```rust
static LED: Mutex<RefCell<Option<PB7<Output<PushPull>>>>> 
    = Mutex::new(RefCell::new(None));
    
static TIMER_TIM2: Mutex<RefCell<Option<Timer<stm32::TIM2>>>> 
    = Mutex::new(RefCell::new(None));
```

Instead of Mutex, RTFM uses `LateResources`. We declare `struct Resources` for all the resources we want to share across different contexts. These resources must be initialized in `init` and returned.

```rust
struct Resources {
    led: PB7<Output<PushPull>>,
    timer: Timer<stm32::TIM2>,
}

#[init]
fn init(cx: init::Context) -> init::LateResources {
    let rcc = cx.device.RCC.constrain();
    let clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze();

    // Set up the LED
    let gpiob = cx.device.GPIOB.split();
    let led = gpiob.pb7.into_push_pull_output();

    // Set up the timer
    let mut timer = Timer::tim2(cx.device.TIM2, 5.hz(), clocks);
    timer.listen(Event::TimeOut);

    // Initialization of late resources
    init::LateResources { led, timer }
}
```

(* If we don’t have late resources, we don’t need to return anything.)

The resources can be safely accessed in tasks. Let’s look at our TIM2 interrupt handler.

```rust
#[task(binds = TIM2, resources = [timer, led])]
fn tim2(cx: tim2::Context) {
    cx.resources.timer.clear_interrupt(Event::TimeOut);
    cx.resources.led.toggle().unwrap();
}
```

`resources = [timer, led])` defines which resources we want to use in this context. We can access them by following a path from context to resources: `cx.resources.timer`, `cx.resources.led`. 

In this interrupt handler, we, using the shared resources, clear the interrupt flag and toggle the LED just like non RTFM version.

That's it. Our first experiment with RTFM. I am liking this framework. I will explore more in the future projects.
