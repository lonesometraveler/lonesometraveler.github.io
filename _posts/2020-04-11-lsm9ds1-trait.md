[LSM9DS1](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm9ds1.pdf) is a 9 axis motion sensor module that comes with accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and temperature sensor. A cool thing about this device is that it has I2C and SPI interfaces. In this post, I will show how I supported both interfaces with `trait`.


## Supporting SPI and I2C interfaces

My first idea was to have two different constructors (one for SPI and the other for I2C) and implement corresponding read and write methods like `spi_write()`, `i2c_write()` at the highest level. But, it didn’t sound right. There would be too much duplicates... So, I decided to solve the problem with a generic trait object.

### Generic interface

First, I defined a trait named `Interface`.  

```rust
/// Interface Trait. `SpiInterface` and `I2cInterface` implement this.
pub trait Interface {
    type Error;

    /// Writes a byte to a sensor's specified register address.
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `sensor` - `Sensor` to talk to
    /// * `addr` - register address
    /// * `value` - value to write
    fn write(&mut self, sensor: Sensor, addr: u8, value: u8) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
    /// Reads multiple bytes from a sensor's specified register address.
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `sensor` - `Sensor` to talk to
    /// * `addr` - register address
    /// * `buffer` - buffer to store read data
    fn read(&mut self, sensor: Sensor, addr: u8, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
}
```

As you can see, there is no real implementation here. This only defines shared behaviors which are meant to be implemented by SPI and I2C types.

### Implementing a trait on a type

Now let's look at SPI and I2C `struct`s. SPI uses chip select pins to address a device to talk to while I2C communicates with a device by specifying its address. So, the `struct`s for SPI and I2C are very different. They take completely different arguments.

Here is how I defined `SpiInterface` type and its `init` method.

```rust
/// This combines the SPI Interface and chip select pins
pub struct SpiInterface<SPI, AG, M> {
    spi: SPI,
    ag_cs: AG,
    m_cs: M,
}

impl<SPI, AG, M, CommE, PinE> SpiInterface<SPI, AG, M>
where
    SPI: Transfer<u8, Error = CommE> + Write<u8, Error = CommE>,
    AG: OutputPin<Error = PinE>,
    M: OutputPin<Error = PinE>,
{
    /// Initializes an Interface with `SPI` instance and AG and M chip select `OutputPin`s
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `spi` - SPI instance
    /// * `ag_cs` - Chip Select pin for Accelerometer/Gyroscope
    /// * `m_cs` - Chip Select pin for Magnetometer
    pub fn init(spi: SPI, ag_cs: AG, m_cs: M) -> Self {
        Self { spi, ag_cs, m_cs }
    }
}
```

And here is `I2cInterface`. It takes I2C addresses.

```rust
/// This holds `I2C` and AG and Mag addresses
pub struct I2cInterface<I2C> {
    i2c: I2C,
    ag_addr: u8,
    mag_addr: u8,
}

impl<I2C> I2cInterface<I2C> {
    /// Initializes an Interface with `I2C` instance and AG and Mag addresses
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `i2C` - I2C instance
    /// * `ag_addr` - `AgAddress`: register address for Accelerometer/Gyroscope
    /// * `mag_addr` - `MagAddress`: register address for Magnetometer
    pub fn init(i2c: I2C, ag_addr: AgAddress, mag_addr: MagAddress) -> Self {
        Self {
            i2c,
            ag_addr: ag_addr.addr(),
            mag_addr: mag_addr.addr(),
        }
    }
}
```

Although the two interfaces are very different, I can make them both `Interface` by implementing `Interface`’s `write` and `read` methods.

Here is the implementation of `Interface ` on `SpiInterface`. You can see how it controls the chip select pins and communicates.

```rust
impl<SPI, AG, M, CommE, PinE> Interface for SpiInterface<SPI, AG, M>
where
    SPI: Transfer<u8, Error = CommE> + Write<u8, Error = CommE>,
    AG: OutputPin<Error = PinE>,
    M: OutputPin<Error = PinE>,
{
    type Error = Error<CommE, PinE>;

    fn write(&mut self, sensor: Sensor, addr: u8, value: u8) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        let bytes = [addr, value];
        match sensor {
            Accelerometer | Gyro | Temperature => {
                self.ag_cs.set_low().map_err(Error::Pin)?;
                self.spi.write(&bytes).map_err(Error::Comm)?;
                self.ag_cs.set_high().map_err(Error::Pin)?;
            }
            Magnetometer => {
                self.m_cs.set_low().map_err(Error::Pin)?;
                self.spi.write(&bytes).map_err(Error::Comm)?;
                self.m_cs.set_high().map_err(Error::Pin)?;
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    fn read(&mut self, sensor: Sensor, addr: u8, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        match sensor {
            Accelerometer | Gyro | Temperature => {
                self.ag_cs.set_low().map_err(Error::Pin)?;
                self.spi.write(&[SPI_READ | addr]).map_err(Error::Comm)?;
                self.spi.transfer(buffer).map_err(Error::Comm)?;
                self.ag_cs.set_high().map_err(Error::Pin)?;
            }
            Magnetometer => {
                self.m_cs.set_low().map_err(Error::Pin)?;
                self.spi
                    .write(&[SPI_READ | MS_BIT | addr])
                    .map_err(Error::Comm)?;
                self.spi.transfer(buffer).map_err(Error::Comm)?;
                self.m_cs.set_high().map_err(Error::Pin)?;
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

And here is the implementation on `I2cInterface`. No chip select pins here. This uses an I2C address to specify a sensor.

```rust
impl<I2C, CommE> Interface for I2cInterface<I2C>
where
    I2C: WriteRead<Error = CommE> + Write<Error = CommE>,
{
    type Error = Error<CommE>;

    fn write(&mut self, sensor: Sensor, addr: u8, value: u8) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        let sensor_addr = match sensor {
            Accelerometer | Gyro | Temperature => self.ag_addr,
            Magnetometer => self.mag_addr,
        };
        core::prelude::v1::Ok(
            self.i2c
                .write(sensor_addr, &[addr, value])
                .map_err(Error::Comm)?,
        )
    }

    fn read(&mut self, sensor: Sensor, addr: u8, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        let sensor_addr = match sensor {
            Accelerometer | Gyro | Temperature => self.ag_addr,
            Magnetometer => self.mag_addr,
        };
        core::prelude::v1::Ok(
            self.i2c
                .write_read(sensor_addr, &[addr], buffer)
                .map_err(Error::Comm)?,
        )
    }
}
```

### Init LSM9DS1 driver with generic

Because both `SpiInterface` and `I2cinterface` are now `Interface`, I can init my driver with generic `T: Interface` instead of a concrete SPI/I2C type. 

```rust
pub struct LSM9DS1<T>
where
    T: Interface,
{
    interface: T,
    accel: AccelSettings,
    gyro: GyroSettings,
    mag: MagSettings,
}
```

The fact that it takes `Interface` means that I can pass either `SpiInterface` or `I2cInterface` to instantiate the driver.
This way, when I talk to a sensor, I can simply call `self.interface.write()` or `self.interface.read()`. 

For example, here is how to get a temperature measurement. It uses a chosen interface to communicate. 

```rust
pub fn read_temp(&mut self) -> Result<f32, T::Error> {
    let mut bytes = [0u8; 2];
    self.interface.read(
        Sensor::Accelerometer,
        register::AG::OUT_TEMP_L.addr(),
        &mut bytes,
    )?;
    let result: i16 = (bytes[1] as i16) << 8 | bytes[0] as i16;
    Ok((result as f32) / TEMP_SCALE + TEMP_BIAS)
}
```

Once I pass the interface to `LSM9DS1` driver, I don’t need to worry about if uses SPI or I2C. There is no need to implement separate methods for SPI and I2C. Pretty cool.

## One more thing…

I found this trait technique really powerful. As an experiment, I also made a fake interface that could be used for testing. This struct implements `Interface` and has arrays that mimic registers. I can read and write these fake registers through the APIs. 

In the end, I did testing at lower levels and didn't really need this interface. But, I learned a lot in the process. I feel much more comfortable with `trait` now.

```rust
//! Fake Interface for unit tests
use super::Interface;
use super::Sensor;
use Sensor::*;

/// Errors in this crate
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Error {
    /// Communication error
    Invalid,
}

/// This holds fake registers
pub struct FakeInterface {
    ag_registers: [u8; 256],
    mag_registers: [u8; 256],
}

impl Default for FakeInterface {
    fn default() -> Self {
        FakeInterface {
            ag_registers: [0u8; 256],
            mag_registers: [0u8; 256],
        }
    }
}

impl FakeInterface {
    /// create a fake interface
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Default::default()
    }
}

/// Implementation of `Interface`
impl Interface for FakeInterface {
    type Error = Error;

    fn write(&mut self, sensor: Sensor, addr: u8, value: u8) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        match sensor {
            Accelerometer | Gyro | Temperature => self.ag_registers[addr as usize] = value,
            Magnetometer => self.mag_registers[addr as usize] = value,
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    fn read(&mut self, sensor: Sensor, addr: u8, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        let registers = match sensor {
            Accelerometer | Gyro | Temperature => self.ag_registers,
            Magnetometer => self.mag_registers,
        };
        for i in 0..buffer.len() {
            buffer[i] = registers[(addr as usize) + i];
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
