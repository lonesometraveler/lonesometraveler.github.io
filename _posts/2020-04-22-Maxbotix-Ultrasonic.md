This week, I played around with an ultrasonic range finder and wrote a little library for it in Rust. The outcome is shown in the image above. This system measures the distance between myself and Ferris. 

I used an ultrasonic sensor from [Maxbotix](https://www.maxbotix.com) to measure distance. This project monitors the sensor's output and shows the measured distance on a LED display.  

Here are two new things I learned from this project:

- How to read microcontroller's timer counter value
- How to convert `u32` (sensor reading) to `&str` (for the display) in a `no-std` environment where `format!` macro is not available


## Ingredients

### Hardware

- [Nucleo-F429ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f429zi.html)
- [Maxbotix RangeFinder LV-EZ1](https://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/MB1010.htm)
- LED display (custom made)
- [Ferris Plushie](https://devswag.com/products/rust-ferris) ðŸ¦€

### Crates

- [`stm32f4xx-hal`](https://crates.io/crates/stm32f4xx-hal) A Rust embedded-hal HAL for all MCUs in the STM32 F4 family
- [`max6955`](https://crates.io/crates/max6955) A platform agnostic driver to interface with MAX6955 LED Display Driver ([See my post about this driver](https://lonesometraveler.github.io/2020/03/20/max6955.html).)
- [`heapless`](https://crates.io/crates/heapless) Heapless, `static` friendly data structures


## Ultrasonic Sensor

Maxbotix ultrasonic sensor measures distance and outputs the reading through PWM or Analog. For this project, I read pulse width with a timer.

The output from the sensor looks like the screenshot below. The pulse width represents distance. You can learn more about pulse width based distance calculation at [Maxbotix website](https://www.maxbotix.com/033-using-pulse-width-pin-2.htm).

Reading the pulse width is straightforward. Basically, I observe the state of the input pin and read the timer counter value. 
When `read` method is called, it goes like this: 
- Wait while the pin is low
- Reset the counter
- Wait while the pin is high
- Read the counter value and return it to the caller


## Implementation

### Three Sensor Models

The sensor comes in 3 models: LV, XL and HR. They all work the same way. Just different resolutions.  To calculate the distance, we use the model specific scale factor.

* LV: 147uS/inch
* XL: 58uS/cm
* HR: 1uS/mm

I define an enum called `Model` like this:

```rust
impl Model {
    /// scale factor
    fn factor(self) -> u32 {
        match self {
            Model::LV => 147,
            Model::XL => 58,
            Model::HR => 1,
        }
    }
    /// unit
    fn unit(self) -> &str {
        match self {
            Model::LV => "\"",
            Model::XL => "cm",
            Model::HR => "mm",
        }
    }
}
```

### Distance measurement using timer counter

I wrote a module called `maxsonar` to measure the pulse width by reading a timer's counter value.

Here is the `struct` for the sensor. It takes a Timer (concrete `TIM2` of the HAL crate), `Model`, and generic `T: InputPin`.

```rust
pub struct MaxSonar<T> {
    timer: TIM2,
    model: Model,
    pin: T,
}

impl<T, E> MaxSonar<T>
where
    T: InputPin<Error = E>,
    E: core::fmt::Debug,
{
    pub fn new(timer: TIM2, model: Model, pin: T, sysclk: Hertz) -> Self {
        // Configure timer for 1Mhz
        let rcc = unsafe { &(*RCC::ptr()) };
        rcc.apb1enr.modify(|_, w| w.tim2en().set_bit());
        let psc = (sysclk.0 / 1_000_000) as u16;
        timer.psc.write(|w| w.psc().bits(psc - 1));
        timer.egr.write(|w| w.ug().set_bit());
        // Start MaxSonar
        let mut sonar = MaxSonar { timer, model, pin };
        sonar.start();
        sonar
    }

    fn start(&mut self) {
        self.timer.cnt.reset();
        self.timer.cr1.write(|w| w.cen().set_bit());
    }
}
```

It looks like `stm32f4xx-hal` doesn't implement a method to read the current timer value. So, I directly access `TIM2`â€™s `cnt` register in my `read` method.

```rust
pub fn read(&mut self) -> u32 {
    while self.pin.is_low().unwrap() {}
    self.timer.cnt.reset();
    while self.pin.is_high().unwrap() {}
    self.timer.cnt.read().bits() / self.model.factor()
}
```

As you can see, I do these:

- Wait while the pin is low
- Reset the counter
- Wait while the pin is high
- Read the counter value

I then calculate the distance by dividing the counter value by the scale factor. `self.model.factor()` returns the scale factor of the chosen model. In this project, I use `Model::LV`. So, the factor is `147`.

### format! in a no-std environment

Great. I now have the distance as `u32`. I just need to convert it to `&str` to show it on my LED display. Here is the definition of the display driver's `write_str` method:

```rust
pub fn write_str(&mut self, text: &str) -> Result<(), E> 
```

In a `std` environment, I would just call `format!` to make a `&str`. But, apparently I cannot do that in a `no-std` environment. After a struggle to find a way to convert `u32` to `&str`, I managed to achieve that with [`heapless`](https://crates.io/crates/heapless) crate. With `heapless::String` and `write!` macro, I can create formatted texts. 

```rust
use core::fmt::Write;
use heapless::consts::*;
use heapless::String;

let mut data = String::<U8>::new();

loop {
    let distance = sonar.read();
    let _ = write!(data, "{:7}{}", distance, sonar.unit());
    max6955.write_str(&data).unwrap();
    data.clear();
}
```

`sonar.unit()` returns the unit for the chosen model. So, it is `"` here.
